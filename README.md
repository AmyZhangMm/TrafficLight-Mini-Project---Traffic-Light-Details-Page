# TrafficLight-Mini-Project---Traffic-Light-Details-Page


Hi Mr. Ganesan,

Please find the files uploaded for your kind review.

The mini project you gave me contains three pages, and I will submit the each page to you after completing.

In the process of completing this page, I have encountered some problems, some of which are still bothering me, I am very grateful that you can give me some valuable suggestions, or share your codes so that I can learn better.

1. When I was checking for responsive, I found that when the width changed to 1024px, my navigation was longer than my other web content, even if I tried wrapping a <div> with class container-fluid outside the <nav>.I realize that I may not be flexible and experienced enough with responsive throughout the web development process.
How did you build this framework, did you consider and take into account the style adjustment of different screen sizes at the same time? In what way is it achieved?

I'll keep looking for answers myself, and I'd appreciate your guidance if could be given to me.



Looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
Amy
